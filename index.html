        <p>I’m an incoming freshman at Dartmouth College. I have a dedicated passion
          for the application of Computer Science to Environmental Sustainability with
          multiple award-winning projects in the area. I believe that
          greentech/cleantech hold the keys to the future with the potential to solve
          the world’s biggest problems.</p>

  <h3>Experience</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Co-Founder, Co-Organizer, and Presenter at TEDxStJohnsPrep</strong> <em>(Sep 2019 - May 2022)</em>
      <p>Obtained a license and secured school funding for the event. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geVfnF9FHR4">After speaking in 2021</a>, I took on a more organizational role and managed the 2022 event. </p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Research Assistant at Worcester Polytechnic Institute</strong> <em>(Jun 2021 - Aug 2021)</em>
      <p>Utilized Robot Operating System (ROS), Python, and computer vision models along with WPI’s Professor Berk Calli to develop robotics for autonomous waste sorting and recycling in the <a href="https://wp.wpi.edu/merlab/">Manipulation and Environmental Robotics Lab (MERL)</a></p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Junior Machine Learning Engineer at Omdena</strong> <em>(Apr 2021 - Jun 2021)</em>
      <p>Classified rooftops through neural networks to eliminate the energy waste of industrial facilities. Used computer vision to classify rooftops, predict energy usage, and calculate solar energy potential (effective area, angle, material, etc). Accepted to a team of 45 collaborators from 18 different countries. View project <a
